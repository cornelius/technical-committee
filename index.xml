Its goal is to facilitate collaboration across organizations so that the huge challenges of the sector can be addressed in a joint effort, effectively and efficiently. The OpenRail Association is open to all participants of the sector, railway companies, vendors, and research institutes, which commit to working on open source software in an open model.</description></item><item><title>DCO</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/dco/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/dco/</guid><description>Signing off commits with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) # In order to provide clarity about the provenance of code being contributed to OpenRail projects, we use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
This means that with each commit the author of the commit includes a statement which means that they are contributing the code under the license of the project, that they have all rights to do so, and that they are fine with this information being stored publicly.</description></item><item><title>License Review</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/joining/onboarding/license-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/joining/onboarding/license-review/</guid><description>Review licensing of future/current OpenRail projects # Doing a license review of a project is part of the OpenRail project incubation process, and it might also make sense to make a review continuously or once in a while. This document presents the necessary and possible steps while the mandatory or optional triggers are discussed in other places.
Our licensing review focuses on the licensing situation of the own code of the project and the used dependencies.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/sandbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/sandbox/</guid><description>Activities at the Sandbox stage # The Sandbox is the initial stage for OpenRail projects. Prerequisite is that the project is committed to run as open source project within the OpenRail Association and matches the basic requirements such as that the code ready to be released under an open source license.
The Sandbox stage is meant for building up the project, establishing open governance and good development practices, and sorting out the structure of the project from a technical and organizational perspective.</description></item><item><title>REUSE</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/reuse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/reuse/</guid><description>Adopt REUSE to ensure licensing transparency # OpenRail projects are supposed to enable users to easily and safely comply with licensing requirements. Starting from Incubation Stage 2, projects are required to adopt REUSE best practices for licensing and copyright information.
REUSE ensures that for every file in a project there is unambiguous information about their license and copyright. It provides a clear standard, along with tools and services, to help with achieving and maintaining this clarity.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/incubated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/incubated/</guid><description>Advancing to the Incubated stage # The Incubated stage is for projects which already have reached a high level of quality and are ready to be used in production. They have mature development practices and a solid base of contributors.
The goal of the Incubated stage is to make the project ready to be considered a standard solution in the domain the project operates in. This includes providing a healthy base of contributors and users from different organizations, putting the project on a broad and stable base.</description></item><item><title>Security</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/security/</guid><description>Establish security best practices # OpenRail projects are supposed to follow security best practices. Especially projects from Incubation Stage 2 onwards must follow these to ensure that users can trust them.
Some best practices are technical, others rather relate to communication and documentation. We are aware that there can be different perspectives on the selection and priority of certain criteria, but this document defines a baseline which the OpenRail projects agree on.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Open Governance</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/joining/governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/joining/governance/</guid><description>Setting up Open Governance # We believe that the full power of open source is unleashed when open source is followed not only by the letter but also in spirit. That&amp;rsquo;s why we require projects to not only adopt an open source license for the code but also an open and transparent collaboration model. We (and others) call that open governance.
Principles # Following the statutes of the OpenRail Association and the charter of its Technical Committee we follow certain principles for open governance:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/graduated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/incubation/graduated/</guid><description> Advancing to the Graduated stage # The Graduated stage is the most advanced and mature stage of the incubation process. This is for projects which have proven to have a great quality and adoption. These are the lighthouse projects the OpenRail Association recommends for production use throughout the industry.
Projects on the Graduated stage are required to have adopted these practices:

As your project shares this space with numerous other repositories and members, some rules have to be followed in order to avoid confusion.
Naming things # Naming is hard. Within OpenRail, all elements such as repositories must be prepended with a unique identifier for your project. For instance, if your project goes by the name &amp;ldquo;Fantasy Open Source Railway Improver&amp;rdquo;, all repositories and team names could start with FOSRI- or fosri-.</description></item></channel></rss>
