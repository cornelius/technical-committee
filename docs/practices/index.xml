This means that with each commit the author of the commit includes a statement which means that they are contributing the code under the license of the project, that they have all rights to do so, and that they are fine with this information being stored publicly.</description></item><item><title>REUSE</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/reuse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/reuse/</guid><description>Adopt REUSE to ensure licensing transparency # OpenRail projects are supposed to enable users to easily and safely comply with licensing requirements. Starting from Incubation Stage 2, projects are required to adopt REUSE best practices for licensing and copyright information.
REUSE ensures that for every file in a project there is unambiguous information about their license and copyright. It provides a clear standard, along with tools and services, to help with achieving and maintaining this clarity.</description></item><item><title>Security</title><link>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cornelius.github.io/technical-committee/docs/practices/security/</guid><description>Establish security best practices # OpenRail projects are supposed to follow security best practices. Especially projects from Incubation Stage 2 onwards must follow these to ensure that users can trust them.
Some best practices are technical, others rather relate to communication and documentation. We are aware that there can be different perspectives on the selection and priority of certain criteria, but this document defines a baseline which the OpenRail projects agree on.</description></item></channel></rss>
